This module introduces you to the fundamentals of Python programming. Work through the resources below in order, and complete the interactive exercises in the Jupyter Notebooks.

### Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook

Before diving into Python, you need to understand the tool you'll be using: Jupyter Notebook. This is an interactive environment where you can write code, see results immediately, and add explanatory text.

📖 [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)

**Interactive Notebook:**
- 📓 [Notebook 1 - Python Foundations](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/refugeescode-data-course-examples-exercises) - Jupyter Notebook introduction, syntax, variables, data types, and collections

### Python Basics: Variables and Data Types

Now that you understand Jupyter Notebooks, let's start with Python fundamentals. You'll learn about variables (how to store information) and the different types of data Python can work with.

📖 [Python Data Types - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp)

**Practice Exercise:**
Complete the variable and data type exercises in Notebook 1 (linked above).

### Collections: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

Once you understand basic data types, you need to learn how to work with collections—ways to store multiple values together.

📽 [Python Dictionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daefaLgNkw0)

📖 [Python Lists - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

📖 [Python Tuples - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)

📖 [Python Sets - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp)

📖 [Python Dictionaries - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)

**Practice Exercise:**
Complete the collections exercises in Notebook 1 (linked above).

### Control Flow: Conditionals

Learn how to make your programs make decisions using if/else statements.

**Interactive Notebook:**
- 📓 [Notebook 2 - Control Flow & Loops](https://github.com/mfrcodingproject/refugeescode-data-course-examples-exercises) - Conditionals and loops (coming soon)

### Loops: For and While

Loops allow you to repeat actions efficiently without writing the same code over and over.

📖 [Python While Loops - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)

**Practice Exercise:**
Complete the loop exercises in Notebook 2 (linked above).

### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They're essential for writing clean, organized programs.

### Working with Strings

Strings (text) are everywhere in programming. Learn how to manipulate and format text in Python.

### Putting It All Together

Once you've completed all the sections above, you'll have a solid foundation in Python programming. Practice is key! The more you code, the more comfortable you'll become.

**Recommended Practice:**
- Work through all the exercises in the Jupyter Notebooks
- Try modifying the code examples to see what happens
- Challenge yourself to write small programs using what you've learned
- Share your code with classmates and discuss different approaches
