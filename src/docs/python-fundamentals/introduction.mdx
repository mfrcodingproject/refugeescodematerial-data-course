## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Programming Fundamentals module! This is where your journey into data analytics truly begins. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and for good reason—it's powerful, versatile, and (relatively) beginner-friendly.

In this module, you'll learn the foundational concepts of programming using Python. These fundamentals will be the building blocks for everything else you do in data analytics: analyzing data, cleaning datasets, creating visualizations, and more.

**Don't worry if you've never programmed before.** Everyone starts somewhere, and we'll guide you through each concept step by step. The key is to practice, experiment, and don't be afraid to make mistakes—that's how you learn!

If you get stuck or have questions, **PLEASE** 🙏🏼 ask your teacher or mentor on the [Slack Channel](https://refugeescode.slack.com/). We're here to help you succeed.

## Goals

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- [ ] Understand what Jupyter Notebooks are and how to use them
- [ ] Write basic Python syntax correctly
- [ ] Work with variables and different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- [ ] Use and manipulate collections (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- [ ] Understand control flow with conditionals (if/else statements)
- [ ] Create and use loops (for loops, while loops)
- [ ] Write and call functions
- [ ] Read and understand basic Python code written by others
- [ ] Debug simple errors in your code
- [ ] Apply Python fundamentals to solve basic problems

## Basic Tools

To complete this module, you'll need:

1. **Jupyter Notebook** - An interactive environment where you can write and run Python code. We'll introduce this in the first lesson.
   - You can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (runs in your browser, no installation needed)
   - Or install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) on your computer (includes Jupyter Notebook)

2. **Python 3.x** - The programming language itself (comes with Anaconda or Google Colab)

3. **A modern web browser** - We recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or Firefox

4. **Curiosity and patience** - Programming is a skill that takes practice. Be patient with yourself!

## What You'll Learn

This module covers:

1. **Jupyter Notebook Basics** - How to work with code cells, markdown cells, and run your programs
2. **Python Syntax & Variables** - The grammar of Python and how to store information
3. **Data Types** - Strings, integers, floats, and booleans
4. **Collections** - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries for storing multiple values
5. **Control Flow** - Making decisions with if/else statements
6. **Loops** - Repeating actions efficiently
7. **Functions** - Creating reusable blocks of code
8. **Error Handling** - Understanding and fixing common errors

## Interactive Learning

Throughout this module, you'll find interactive exercises directly in the Jupyter Notebooks. These exercises are designed to help you practice what you've just learned. **Please complete them!** Programming is a hands-on skill—you can't learn it just by reading.

We encourage you to:
- Experiment with the code examples
- Try modifying them to see what happens
- Complete all the practice exercises
- Ask questions when you're stuck
- Share your solutions and ideas with classmates

Remember: there's often more than one way to solve a programming problem. Discussing different approaches with your peers will make you a better programmer.

## Let's Get Started!

Python is used by companies like Google, Netflix, NASA, and countless data teams around the world. By the end of this module, you'll have the foundation to start writing your own Python programs and analyzing real data.

Let's go! 🚀
